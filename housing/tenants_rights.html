    <h1>North Carolina Tenants' Rights</h1>
    <p>In North Carolina, tenants have several rights, including the following:</p>

    <h2>1. Habitable Housing</h2>
    <p>Landlords are responsible for keeping the rental unit habitable. Tenants can move out if the landlord fails to do so.</p>

    <h2>2. Quiet Enjoyment</h2>
    <p>Tenants have the right to live in peace and quiet without being disturbed by their landlord or other tenants.</p>

    <h2>3. Security Deposits</h2>
    <p>Landlords must return a tenant's security deposit unless there is a valid reason to keep it.</p>

    <h2>4. Evictions</h2>
    <p>Landlords cannot remove a tenant without filing an eviction court case and receiving a judgment from a judge or magistrate.</p>
